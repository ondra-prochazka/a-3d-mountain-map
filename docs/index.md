title: "A 3D Mountain Map of the Earth"
---

![Panorama of Lusatia](media/lusatia.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

This webpage has been created as a simple demonstration of how a global
interactive 3D map of Earth mountains, adhering to the time-proven rules of
cartographic design, may be built with open-source technology and freely
available data.

[Simply browse the mountain map][1]{:target="_blank"} with a WebGL-enabled browser. 

Alernatively, here is a tour of some interesting locations, which might
serve as your starting point:

* [San Diego County (southern California), looking north-west][3]{:target="_blank"}

* [San Jacinto Peak (southern California), looking south-east][14]{:target="_blank"}

* [Mount Whitney (central California), bird's eye view from north-east][11]{:target="_blank"}

* [The North Cascades (Washington State)][9]{:target="_blank"}

* [Isanotski and Shishaldin volcanoes (Aleutian Islands, Alaska)][13]{:target="_blank"}

* [The viewing platform at Crotched Mountain (New Hampshire)][10]{:target="_blank"}

* [Summit view from Mont Blanc (France/Italy/Switzerland), looking east][15]{:target="_blank"}

* [Matterhorn (Switzerland)][7]{:target="_blank"}

* [The Wetterstein mountain range (Germany/Austria)][5]{:target="_blank"}

* [Loferer und Leoganger Steinberge (Austria)][6]{:target="_blank"}

* [The Alps from the North][8]{:target="_blank"}

* [Krkono≈°e Mountain Range (Czech Republic/Poland) from the south][18]{:target="_blank"}

* [Mount Narodnaya, Nether-polar Ural mountains (Russia)][12]{:target="_blank"}

* [Nanga Parbat, Gilgit Baltistan (Pakistan)][16]{:target="_blank"}

* [Ngorongoro Highlands (Tanzania), looking west][4]{:target="_blank"}

* [Table Mountain National Park (South Africa)][17]{:target="_blank"}

## How Was the Map Created?

The map was built using [vts-geospatial][19]{:target="_blank"}, an
open-source 3D geospatial software stack designed and developed by [Melown
Technologies SE][20]{:target="_blank"}.

The complete source code of this project (and of this website) is [available
in an accompanying GitHub repository][21]{:target="_blank"}, and you are
welcome to play with it and use as inspiration for your own 3D mapping projects. 
Simple instructions on how to recreate the map are available [in the
repository's
README][22]{:target="_blank"}.

## The FOSS4G 2019 NA talk

This website has been created to accompany my talk "Visual Hierarchies in 3D
cartography With VTS", first held at FOSS4G-NA 2019 in San Diego in April 2019. 

In the talk, the map is created from scratch in a simple tutorial. Links to the
configuration files and styles used in the tutorial are given below for a
clear reference.

The view overlooking Mount Rainier to the north is used to demonstrate the
state of the map after every step.

#### Step 1 - The Basemap

**Code**: 

 * [new storage view definition][28]{:target="_blank"}

[State of the map after this step][23]{:target="_blank"}. 
    
#### Step 2 - The Ultra-prominent Peaks

**Code**: 

 * [new geodata free layer in vts-mapproxy][29]{:target="_blank"}
 * [free layer stylesheet][30]{:target="_blank"}
 * [updated storage view with the new free layer][31]{:target="_blank"}

[State of the map after this step][24]{:target="_blank"}.

#### Step 3 - Mountains and Settlements from OSM

**Code**: 

 * [new free layer stylesheet][32]{:target="_blank"}
 * [updated storage view with the new free layer][33]{:target="_blank"}

[State of the map after this step][25]{:target="_blank"}.

#### Step 4 - The Intellectual Hierarchy

**Code**: 

 * [updated storage view][34]{:target="_blank"}
 * [updated osm free layer stylesheet][35]{:target="_blank"}
 * [updated ultra-prominent-peaks stylesheet][36]{:target="_blank"}

[State of the map after this step][26]{:target="_blank:}.

#### Step 5 - The Visual Hierarchy

**Code**: 

 * [updated storage view][37]{:target="_blank"}
 * [updated osm free layer stylesheet][38]{:target="_blank"}
 * [updated ultra-prominent-peaks stylesheet][39]{:target="_blank"}

[State of the map after this step][27]{:target="_blank"}.

## Desktop Version of the Map

![Kilimanjaro and Meru in vts-desktop-cpp](media/kilimanjaro.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}


You might also want to consider taking a look at the mountain map in
[vts-browser-cpp desktop][2]{:target="_blank"}.  Though the whitewash and
vertical-exaggeration techniques used in the mountain map are not yet fully
reflected in the current version of vts-browser-cpp, the realistic physical
atmosphere and enhanced navigation capabilities provide for a beautiful,
almost Zen-like experience.
